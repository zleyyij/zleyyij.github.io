This post mostly serves as a collection of extremely useful resources that I find convenient to group together

# Homelabbing
For most of these, you'll need a dedicated server. A used optiplex, or Raspberry Pi or alternative is fine.

Ideally, you'd find something from this list that's actually useful to you.

# Software Development
I specifically enjoyed reading through [this](https://os.phil-opp.com/) series explaining how to write an operating system. You don't need to understand Rust for the theory section of it.
